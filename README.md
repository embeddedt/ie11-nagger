# ie11-nagger

This is a simple script which will remind IE11 users their browser is old.

There is no dependency on Webpack or any other build tool. All you have to do is add the script to your HTML.

Example usage:

```html
!<doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
         <!-- It also works in the <body> -->
         <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ie11-nagger@1.0.0/ie11-nagger.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
```
